### Aim

The aim of this experiment is to solve systems of simultaneous linear equations using numerical matrix-based techniques by performing the following steps:

1. To represent the system of linear equations in matrix form.
2. To apply Gaussian Elimination for transforming the system into an upper triangular form and obtaining solutions through back-substitution.
3. To implement the Gauss-Jordan Method for converting the augmented matrix into reduced row-echelon form to directly obtain the final solutions.
4. To compare the working principles and outcomes of both methods in terms of accuracy and computational effort.
5. To understand how these numerical techniques are used in scientific and engineering applications where large systems of equations need to be solved efficiently.
