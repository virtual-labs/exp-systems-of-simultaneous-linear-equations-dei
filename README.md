### About the Experiment  

This experiment focuses on solving systems of simultaneous linear equations using direct numerical methods, specifically Gaussian Elimination and Gauss-Jordan methods. These techniques systematically reduce the system of equations to simpler forms, allowing for exact numerical solutions in a finite number of steps. Students learn the process of forward elimination, back substitution, and matrix row operations that transform equations into reduced row echelon form. The experiment also highlights the computational efficiency, potential numerical instability, and practical applications of these methods in scientific computing, engineering, and data analysis.
