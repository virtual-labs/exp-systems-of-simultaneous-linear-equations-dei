### Procedure

1. **Select the Solving Method**
   - Choose either **Gaussian Elimination** or **Gauss-Jordan Elimination** from the dropdown menu.

2. **Enter the Linear Equations**
   - Input the coefficients of the linear system in the form:
     - a₁x + b₁y = c₁
     - a₂x + b₂y = c₂
   - Alternatively, select one of the example equations provided in the interface.

3. **Initialize System Parameters**
   - Ensure all coefficient fields are correctly filled.
   - Check if the equations form a valid linear system (non-zero determinant for unique solution).

4. **Run the Simulation**
   - Click on the **Simulate** button to perform matrix operations.

5. **View Output**
   - Check the solution results displayed in the result panel.
   - Observe the computed values of variables (x and y).
   - If available, review steps or graphical representation showing equation intersection point.

6. **Analyze the Result**
   - Verify correctness by substituting the solution back into the original equations.
   - Repeat using the other elimination method to compare solution approach and clarity.
